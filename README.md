## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using align self on a flex item is a handy way to position the item. Below I use align self to center the wrapping div of the input and button elements in the form.

```css
form div {
    align-self: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue building web pages to improve my layout skills. 

### Useful resources

- [css tricks grid article](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - A very helpful resource when working with css grid.
